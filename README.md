# Xanadu

Xanadu is a framework for developing Database Driven Web Apps. 

Xanadu uses PHP, MySQL, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and Javascript with several amazing includes.

We've been developing Database Apps for decades with FileMaker and Xojo. FileMaker rocks but licensing became too expensive. Xojo has fantastic pricing, but is perpetually buggy. We had to find an alternative platform. PHP kept coming up in our searches. Long story short, we decided PHP is the best option just to get back to an affordable and solid platform.
